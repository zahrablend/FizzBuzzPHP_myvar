## ow it works:

A user is prompted to enter 2 numbers - one for the beginning of array and one for the last number in the chosen array.
The program prints all numbers in users' array, replacing numbers that match a certain condition with an explanatory note.
The program notifies about numbers that can be divided without a remainder to:

- 3, 5 or 10
- both 3 and 5
- both 5 and 10
- to all 3, 5 and 10

The program counts how many numbers in each category and how many times certain keyword repeats in a given range of numbers.
